If you have previously searched any cities, they will show up below the search bar. You may click on the previously searched cities as well instead of typing the city name again.

## Bugs

Currently, the icons in the 5-day weather forecast add together instead of replacing the previous one. The last icon in the series is the icon representation of the most recently searched city.
